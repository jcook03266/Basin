## Meet Brookyln's Premiere Laundry Service

Welcome to the only laundromat and dry cleaning service platform that can satisfy Brooklyn's constant hustle and bustle. Whether picking up laundry, dropping it off, or getting it delivered, Basin is here every step of the way ðŸ’ª

## Proudly Partnered With:
- [Stuy Wash N' Dry]([https://www.google.com](https://www.stuywashndryny.com/)) 

## Q&A:
### What Does Basin Offer?
- Residental & Commercial laundry pick-up/delivery services so that you never have to even look at your dirty clothes.


### How is this App Structured?
Basin is structured around 3 authorized user bases:
- Customers (Remote / Transient Clients)
- Delivery Drivers (Transient Clients)
- Business Employees (Point of Sale Clients) 

Customers and Delivery driver users are considered transients meaning they operate in one location for short periods of time, they're on the move and should be treated as such. The Business clients are considered fixed, their data propagation and UI reflect this fixed nature, their UI doesn't operate around movement, rather confirming orders, updating received orders to provide customers with real-time data, and marking orders for delivery.

The app supports 3 of the enumerated user types, but outside of this the platform's backend architecture is structured around 5 user types, with business administrator being 1, and developer being the last and highest level. Business administrators are above employees, they are the owners of the laundromats and or trusted high-level associates that require access to all of the business's data. Administrators can create each physical location and supply it with descriptive metadata, and if not desired an engineer can go out to the location to take photos and gather other important information about the site to create an online entity representing it. 

These two extraneous user types are only permissible on the website [Basin.io](https://www.basin.io). The web app allows for all data-sensitive operations to be carried out in a clean, high fidelity, professional, and secure environment. The employees of said business can also use the website, with the only exception being delivery drivers and customers who are locked to the mobile application for now due to the complexity of implementation.
